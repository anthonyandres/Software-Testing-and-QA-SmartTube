# Software-Testing-and-QA-SmartTube

## Preface

This repository contains unit testing of various methods within Yuliskov's open source project [SmartTube](https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTube) and their other repository containing various utility files: [SharedModules](https://github.com/yuliskov/SharedModules ) . 

## Introduction

In this project, fifteen different methods were selected from the Java application and tested on using four different testing abstractions. These include Input Space Partitioning (ISP), graph based testing with Control Flow and Data Flow Graphs (CFG and DFG respectively), logic-based testing, and mutation testing.

A majority of the testing was done in the Eclipse Java IDE using the JUnit testing library as well as the PitClipse plugin for mutation testing. Control flow and data flow graphs were created using the free to use web application Lucidchart.
